## 🚀 What We Learned

Here’s a quick summary of what we covered in this project:

-  **Animated Character** — Created a character with `Rigidbody2D` and collision detection.  
-  **Prefabs & Instantiation** — Built pipe prefabs and spawned them with random vertical positions.  
-  **Game Manager Integration** — Connected game logic to the **UI Canvas** for live score updates.  
-  **Trigger Events** — Used `OnTrigger2D` to increase the player’s score.  
-  **Collision Handling** — Applied `OnCollision2D` to manage fail and game-over conditions.
